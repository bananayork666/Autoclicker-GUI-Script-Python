## Introduction

The Autoclicker GUI Script is a simple application that automates mouse clicks. It is built using Python and employs various libraries to create a user-friendly interface. The main goal of this project is to test my skills in Python and GUI development.

## Features

- **Simple User Interface**: Built with CustomTkinter for easy navigation.
- **Adjustable Click Speed**: Set the speed of clicks according to your needs.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Easily control the autoclicker with a button.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use keyboard shortcuts for quick access.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several libraries and tools:

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **CustomTkinter**: A modern GUI toolkit for creating user interfaces.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating mouse clicks and keyboard actions.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks if needed in the future.
- **Threading**: To run the clicking process without freezing the UI.
- **Time**: To manage delays between clicks.

## Installation

To get started with the Autoclicker GUI Script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bananayork666/Autoclicker-GUI-Script-Python.git
   cd Autoclicker-GUI-Script-Python
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python autoclicker.py
   ```
#Use elevated panel for managerial tasks!

## Usage

Once you have installed the script, follow these steps to use it:

1. **Open the Application**: Run the script as described in the installation section.
2. **Set Click Speed**: Use the slider to adjust the click speed.
3. **Start Clicking**: Click the "Start" button to begin the autoclicking process.
4. **Stop Clicking**: Click the "Stop" button to halt the autoclicker.
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can use specific keyboard shortcuts to control the application without using the mouse.
